Some advantages of multiprocessor system are as follows:

• Reduced Cost: Multiple processors share the same resources. Separate power supply or mother board for each chip is not required. 
This reduces the cost.

• Increased Reliability: The reliability of system is also increased. 
The failure of one processor does not affect the other processors though it will slow down the machine. 
Several mechanisms are required to achieve increased reliability. If a processor fails, a job running on that processor also fails. 
The system must be able to reschedule the failed job or to alert the user that the job was not successfully completed.

• Increased Throughput: An increase in the number of processes completes the work in less time. 
It is important to note that doubling the number of processors does not halve the time to complete a job. 
It is due to the overhead in communication between processors and contention for shared resources etc.
