What is a real time system?
Definition 1:
A real-time system is one that must process information and produce a response within a specified time, else risk severe consequences, 
including failure. That is, in a system with a real-time constraint it is no good to have the correct action or the correct 
answer after a certain deadline: it is either by the deadline or it is useless!
 
Definition 2 (modified from The Oxford Dictionary of Computing):
Any system in which the time at which output is produced is significant. 
This is usually because the input corresponds to some event in the physical world, and the output has to relate to that same event. 
The lag from input time to output time must be sufficiently small for acceptable timeliness
